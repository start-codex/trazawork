# Changelog

This file tracks notable changes to Taskcore.

The project does not use tagged releases yet. Until versioning starts, history is recorded using an `Unreleased` section for ongoing work, plus dated milestone entries for committed historical work.

Contributors should add ongoing changes to the `Unreleased` section. When a milestone or release happens, move those entries into a new dated section at the top of the history.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added session storage foundation (`internal/sessions`): `Create`, `Validate`, `Delete`
- Added SHA-256 token hashing — raw tokens never stored in the database
- Added archived-user rejection in session validation (`ErrUserArchived`)
- Added migration `0003_create_sessions` with indexes on `user_id` and `expires_at`
- Added workspace-scoped URL routing (`/{workspace}/...`)
- Added Kanban and Scrum project templates with localized status names per user language
- Added project creation wizard: step 1 template selection, step 2 name and key
- Added empty states with action buttons across all pages (no workspace, no projects, no boards, no statuses)
- Added settings page with language switcher
- Added projects overview dashboard at `/{workspace}/`
- Added `withAuth` session middleware with allowlist for public routes
- Added `GET /auth/me` endpoint — always 200, distinguishes auth errors from internal errors
- Added `POST /auth/logout` endpoint — idempotent, clears cookie, returns 204
- Added `internal/authctx` package for typed context user ID helpers
- Added `sessions.IsAuthError` helper for centralized error classification
- Added a root changelog to track notable project changes
- Added a README link to the changelog

### Changed
- Changed `POST /auth/login` to create session and set `HttpOnly` cookie with `SameSite=Strict`
- Changed `GET /users/{userID}` to enforce self-only access (403 on mismatch)
- Changed login to reject archived users before session creation
- Changed workspace creation to add creator as owner member in a single transaction
- Changed sidebar workspace selection to sync via URL navigation instead of local state
- Changed board view to sync statuses on navigation via `$effect`
