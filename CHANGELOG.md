# Changelog

This file tracks notable changes to Tookly.

The project does not use tagged releases yet. Until versioning starts, history is recorded using an `Unreleased` section for ongoing work, plus dated milestone entries for committed historical work.

Contributors should add ongoing changes to the `Unreleased` section. When a milestone or release happens, move those entries into a new dated section at the top of the history.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added session storage foundation (`internal/sessions`): `Create`, `Validate`, `Delete`
- Added SHA-256 token hashing — raw tokens never stored in the database

- Added workspace-scoped URL routing (`/{workspace}/...`)
- Added Kanban and Scrum project templates with localized status names per user language

- Added settings page with language switcher
- Added projects overview dashboard at `/{workspace}/`
- Added `withAuth` session middleware with allowlist for public routes
- Added `GET /auth/me` endpoint — always 200, distinguishes auth errors from internal errors

- Added workspace membership enforcement on all API routes (read and write)

- Changed `internal/authctx` consolidated into `internal/authz`
- Changed `POST /workspaces` to derive owner from authenticated session (removed `owner_id` from request body)
- Changed `GET /workspaces` to derive user from authenticated session (removed `user_id` query parameter)
- Changed `POST /projects/{projectID}/issues` to derive reporter from authenticated session (removed `reporter_id` from request body)

- Changed frontend auth store to in-memory only (removed localStorage persistence)
